# Website Designs

I use a piece of software called [Figma](https://figma.com) to create all of my UI/UX designs.

The project on Figma, including all Prototyping, can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/wtMpoiXyYCwDKLx5fCM4Hx/College-Unit-6---Assignment-Two?type=design&node-id=5%3A342&mode=design&t=CzeBkApgZt3Pev1x-1).

Or you can see the wireframe designs [here](./wireframe)
